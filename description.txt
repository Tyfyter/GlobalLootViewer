Adds a bestiary entry that shows global loot drops
Highlights conditional drops that could currently drop
Adds a kill counter to the bestiary

Changelog:
1.2.3:
now displays item loot (such as items from treasure bags)

1.2.2:
no longer relies on adding NPCs and instead replaces the nonexistent entries for Pirate's Curse and Spiked Blue Slimes (so unfortunately it won't work with mods that add entries for these, I tried to use size variants of pincushion zombies but I couldn't get the entries to show up)
